# Python Projects
Over 4 years of study at Princeton University and through my experiences doing freelance work, internships, contractual roles and professional coding, I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from traditional Backend Engineering, Full Stack Software Engineering and Web Design to  Quantitative Analysis Data Analytics, Robotic Process Automation and Beginner Level Machine Learning/NLP projects. This repository contains samples of some of this work that was done using Python. 

I plan to diversify this work into different repos as I develop my data engineering and software develop my coding and quant as well as data analysis skills over my career. While having worked with Git earlier, while coding a Backend Repository that comprised an API independent client for Dotdash, this is my first proper github repo and I am excited to share it with and learn through feedback from the online coding community.
